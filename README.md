# astarr.me -- My personal website!

Originally designed for use in a project with Dartmouth College's Digital Arts Leadership and Innovation (DALI) Laboratory.
I retrofitted it later on to become my personal website.

astarr.me was modeled after traditional postcards. I wanted to capture my love for creative writing and imagination while
showcasing some of my most recent projects. Developed with vanilla HTML5 and CSS3.

## TODO:
* Adding some more of my personal projects and repos (Jar website, loading animation, etc)
* Updating new information as I continue to grow my skills
